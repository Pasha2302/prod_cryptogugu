        <p>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>

        <div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

        <div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <ul class="wp-block-list">
          <li>Consent. We may process your information if you have permitted us (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>

          <li>Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>

          <li>Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="wp-block-list">
          <li>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</li>

          <li>Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as in situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
        </ul>

        <div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <p>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>

        <div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

        <div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>

        <div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <ul class="wp-block-list">
          <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>

          <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>

          <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>

          <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>

          <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>

          <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>

          <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>

          <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>

          <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>

Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications.

        <p>
          We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice: <a href="http://www.cryptogugu.com/cookie-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><em>http://www.cryptogugu.com/cookie-policy</em></a><em>.</em>

        <div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than three (3) months past the termination of the user’s account.</p>

        <div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

        <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.

        <div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (‘DNT’) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
